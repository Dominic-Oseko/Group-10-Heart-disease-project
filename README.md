# Group-10-HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION PROJECT
## PREDICTING THE LIKELIHOOD OF HEART DISEASE FROM PATIENTS
## PROJECT UNDERSTANDING
#### Heart disease remains a significant public health concern in Kenya, with increasing cases linked to lifestyle changes, urbanization and inadequate access to preventive healthcare. Despite growing awareness, early detection and treatment, risk assessment remains a challenge due to limited local research and data-driven insights. This study aims to analyze key health indicators. By identifying major risk factors and trends, this research seeks to support healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers in developing targeted interventions, improving early diagnosis, and enhancing public health strategies to combat heart disease in Kenya. The model will leverage data from the "heart_disease.csv" dataset, which includes demographic information, clinical measurements and historical health data.
### Objectives
#### i) To develop a Predictive Model by creating a machine learning that accurately predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.
#### ii) To identify Key Risk Factors which are the most significant predictors of heart disease. 
#### iii) To provide healthcare professionals with a tool that aids in the early detection and management of heart disease.
#### iv) To make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and preventive care strategies based on model predictions.
#### V) Increase awareness of heart disease risk factors among patients and the general public through educational materials and outreach programs.
## DATA UNDERSTANDING
#### Our data was extracted from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/heart-disease) which has 21 columns and 10,000 rows. The data has both numerical and categorical features. The lebel encoding was useful for ordinal data in categorical featuresIt to ensure that the model can interpret the data, detect patterns, and make predictions effectively.
