    "The primary objective of this capstone project is to create a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on a variety of health-related features. The model will leverage data from the \"heart_disease.csv\" dataset, which includes demographic information, clinical measurements, and historical healt data."

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Heart disease remains a significant public health concern in Kenya, with increasing cases linked to lifestyle changes, urbanization, and inadequate access to preventive healthcare. Despite growing awareness, early detection and risk assessment remain challenging due to limited local research and data-driven insights. This study aims to analyze key health indicators. By identifying major risk factors and trends, this research seeks to support healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers in developing targeted interventions, improving early diagnosis, and enhancing public health strategies to combat heart disease in Kenya."

    "### General Objectives\n",
    "1. Developing a Predictive Model:\n",
    "- Objective: Create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.\n",
    "- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).\n",
    "- Outcome: A validated model that can be used in clinical settings to assess patient risk.\n",
    "2. Identify Key Risk Factors:\n",
    "- Objective: Analyze the dataset to determine which features are the most significant predictors of heart disease.\n",
    "- KPIs: Identification of top risk factors, correlation coefficients, and feature importance scores.\n",
    "- Outcome: A report detailing the primary risk factors associated with heart disease, which can inform patient education and preventive strategies.\n",
    "3. Enhance Patient Care:\n",
    "- Objective: Provide healthcare professionals with a tool that aids in the early detection and management of heart disease.\n",
    "- KPIs: User satisfaction ratings, number of healthcare providers using the tool, and feedback from clinical trials.\n",
    "- Outcome: Improved patient outcomes through timely interventions based on risk assessments generated by the model.\n",
    "4. Facilitate Data-Driven Decision Making:\n",
    "- Objective: Enable healthcare organizations to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and preventive care strategies based on model predictions.\n",
    "- KPIs: Changes in resource allocation, reduction in hospital admissions for heart disease, and improved health outcomes in high-risk populations.\n",
    "- Outcome: A framework for integrating predictive analytics into healthcare decision-making processes.\n",
    "5. Raise Awareness and Educate Patients:\n",
    "- Objective: Increase awareness of heart disease risk factors among patients and the general public through educational materials and outreach programs.\n",
    "- KPIs: Number of educational sessions conducted, patient engagement metrics, and changes in patient knowledge and behavior regarding heart health.\n",
    "- Outcome: A more informed patient population that actively participates in their health management, leading to a reduction in heart disease prevalence."

    "### Metrics of success (benefits)\n",
    "- Early Detection and Prevention- will help identidy individuals who are at high risk of heart diseases before symptoms appear. This will also lead to encouaraging early lifestyle changes to prevent disease progression and access the right medication which reduces the long run costs.\n",
    "- Personalized Healthcare-Helps doctors and patients make informed decisions based on personal risk factors and make proper judgement on tests and screenings to be done.\n",
    "- Cost Savings in Healthcare- By detecting this symptoms early and managing risk factors, you reduce hospital admissions.Lowers the burden on insurance and healthcare systems by minimizing costly late-stage treatments.\n",
    "- Research and Development- A predictive model can aid in medical research by identifying new patterns in heart disease risks.Provides insights into key factors contributing to heart disease, leading to better prevention strategies.\n",
    "- Data-Driven Public Health Strategies- Helps governments and healthcare organizations design policies to reduce heart disease prevalence and allow government to make better budget allocations to deal with these cases."

    "Columns Descriptions\n",
    "- Age; Represents the age of the individual in years. Age is a significant risk factor for heart disease, with older individuals generally at higher risk.\n",
    "- Gender; Indicates the gender of the individual, typically coded as 0 for female and 1 for male. Gender can influence the risk of heart disease due to biological and lifestyle factors.\n",
    "- Blood Pressure; Refers to the individual's blood pressure reading, usually measured in mmHg (millimeters of mercury). High blood pressure (hypertension) is a major risk factor for heart disease.\n",
    "- Cholesterol Level; Represents the total cholesterol level in the blood, measured in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). High cholesterol levels can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing heart disease risk.\n",
    "- Exercise Habit; Indicates the frequency or quality of physical activity the individual engages in. Regular exercise is associated with a lower risk of heart disease.\n",
    "- Smoking; Indicates whether the individual smokes tobacco, often coded as 0 for non-smokers and 1 for smokers. Smoking is a well-known risk factor for heart disease.\n",
    "- Family Heart Disease; Indicates whether there is a family history of heart disease, typically coded as 0 for no family history and 1 for a positive family history. A family history can increase an individual's risk.\n",
    "- Diabetes; Indicates whether the individual has diabetes, often coded as 0 for non-diabetics and 1 for diabetics. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for heart disease.\n",
    "- BMI (Body Mass Index); A measure of body fat based on height and weight, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. A high BMI can indicate obesity, which is a risk factor for heart disease.\n",
    "- High Blood Pressure; Indicates whether the individual has been diagnosed with high blood pressure, typically coded as 0 for no and 1 for yes. This is a direct risk factor for heart disease.\n",
    "- Low LDL Cholesterol; Refers to low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often considered \"good\" cholesterol. Low HDL levels can increase the risk of heart disease.\n",
    "- High LDL Cholesterol; Refers to high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often considered \"bad\" cholesterol. High LDL levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.\n",
    "- Alcohol Consumption; Indicates the amount of alcohol consumed by the individual, often measured in standard drinks per week. Excessive alcohol consumption can contribute to heart disease.\n",
    "- Stress Level; Represents the individual's perceived level of stress, which can be measured through various scales. High stress levels can negatively impact heart health.\n",
    "- Sleep Hour; Indicates the average number of hours the individual sleeps per night. Poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep are linked to an increased risk of heart disease.\n",
    "- Sugar Consumption; Refers to the amount of sugar consumed by the individual, often measured in grams per day. High sugar intake can contribute to obesity and diabetes, increasing heart disease risk.\n",
    "- Triglyceride Level; Represents the level of triglycerides in the blood, measured in mg/dL. High triglyceride levels can increase the risk of heart disease.\n",
    "- Fasting Blood Sugar; Indicates the blood sugar level after fasting, measured in mg/dL. Elevated fasting blood sugar levels can indicate diabetes or prediabetes, which are risk factors for heart disease.\n",
    "- CRP Level (C-Reactive Protain Level; Measures the level of C-reactive protein in the blood, which can indicate inflammation. High CRP levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.\n",
    "- Homocystein Level; Refers to the level of homocysteine in the blood, an amino acid that, at elevated levels, can increase the risk of heart disease.\n",
    "- Heart Disease Status; Indicates whether the individual has been diagnosed with heart disease, typically coded as 0 for no heart disease and 1 for heart disease. This is the target variable for predictive modeling."
